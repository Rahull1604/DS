# Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my repository! I’ve always had a passion for problem-solving and optimizing solutions, and I wanted to share that knowledge with all of you. In this repository, I’ve compiled content from my exploration and deep understanding of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**—the backbone of efficient programming.

## What's Inside?

Throughout my journey, I’ve worked extensively with a variety of data structures and algorithms. Here’s a glimpse of what you'll find in this repository:

- **Linked Lists**: A deep dive into singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, including detailed explanations and implementations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Concepts behind stack and queue operations, showcasing practical usage with examples.
- **Infix, Postfix, and Prefix Expressions**: Understanding these notations and converting between them, with clear, step-by-step processes.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of linear search, binary search, and other fundamental searching methods.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Efficient sorting techniques such as bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, and their real-world applications.

## Why Data Structures and Algorithms?

Mastering **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** is crucial for writing efficient code. These are the tools that allow us to:
- Optimize our solutions, making them more scalable and responsive.
- Improve our problem-solving skills, enabling us to tackle complex challenges.
- Ace coding interviews and technical assessments, as these topics form the foundation of most interview questions.

I believe that by sharing this content, I can help others strengthen their core programming skills and develop an intuitive understanding of how different structures and algorithms work in tandem.
